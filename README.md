## Comparative Analysis of Lossless Data Compression Algorithms On Genetic Code for Biological Species.
Motivation and Need: 
In every mRNA sequence, thereâ€™s approximately 3 million nucleotides (A, U, G, C)
To store these as strings of lengths greater than 3 million is tedious and would take up a lot of storage.
Compression of genomic sequences can decrease the storage requirements, and increase the transmission speed which can be useful for synthesis of medicines and genetic engineering. Various lossless data compression algorithms may be used to achieve this.
Our project serves the purpose of compressing the given strings using Huffman Encoding, Run Length Encoding and LZW compression, while simultaneously acting as a tool to compare the compression algorithms and calculate the save percentage.

# Algorithmic Strategy used

RLE, LZW and Huffman Coding are all lossless data compression algorithms that can be used to encode as well as decode our input of the rna sequence. Reasons for choosing these algorithms:
RLE: 
Counts the consecutive repetition amount of a symbol and uses that value to represent the run.
Efficient with files that contain lots of repetitive data and does not require much CPU horsepower.
LZW: 
Creates a key value pair for every new sequence of input
The key value dictionary does not need to be passed on to the decompression part 
Huffman Coding: 
Huffman takes advantage of the disparity between frequencies and uses less storage for the frequently occurring characters
This is at the expense of using more storage for rare characters, however as are inputs would be only 4 characters, this drawback does not apply here
